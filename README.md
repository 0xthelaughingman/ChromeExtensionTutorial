# ChromeExtensionTutorial
This is a tutorial repository for the Extension idea.
The objective of the extension is to be able to manipulate the webcam/device's video with the tensorflow.js/Body Pix
and other such modules to substitute the User's body, which can then be used by the page for the stream.

Each folder represents an incremental stage in the tutorial towards achieving our desired objective.



# The Stages

1. userMedia: Deals with accessing the device's camera feed through the browser's getUserMedia API.

2. Overriding userMedia: To be able to manipulate what we want to be presented as the camera's feed on the page, we have to
first override the default behaviour of the API, so that we can do with the stream as we wish.

3. Stream From a Canvas: Testing the Canvas element. Here, we have a canvas with an animation effect. We want the canvas to
serve as the stream source for the Video element. This is critical as manipulating a stream involves breaking it into images(Frames),
customizing the Frames as we want and then serving them up as a stream - All of which will involve the canvas element.

4. Manipulating live stream: With the getUserMedia API overriden, return the stream from our canvas while using the actual *raw* stream
for getting the frames for the Canvas, animating the frames together to form a 'video'. Apply the simple grayscale filter.

5. Hide canvas: Given the canvas is what *we* require to achieve what is needed, hide it from the User.

6. BodyPix: Trying out the Tensorflow.js - BodyPix. Slight changes to how we handle the stream and the rendering in order to be able to
make use of the model and it's output.
    * Using a secondary canvas to first generate an image from the frame and feed into the model.
    * Writing the model's output onto the primary panel.
    * This is done to avoid irregular animations between modified and unmodified states if using the same canvas...
    * Way too high RAM and GPU usage... might need optimizations? Maybe try out cloud interactions via 
    Firebase deployment...

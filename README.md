# ChromeExtensionTutorial
This is a tutorial repository for the Extension idea.
The objective of the extension is to be able to manipulate the webcam/device's video with the tensorflow.js/Body Pix
and other such modules to substitute the User's body, which can then be used by the page for the stream.

Each folder represents an incremental stage in the tutorial towards achieving our desired objective.
